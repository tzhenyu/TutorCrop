# Tutorial PDF Cropper
I was annoyed by the university's tutorial file that lists questions without the gap below it. It is difficult for me to write answer beside the question. So I was thinking 'it would be nice if I can write the answer to each question below so I can reference it better in the future'.

So why not make a script for it ? 

This repo uses OpenCV to recognize the question block, crop it, create a gap below each question block, and create a new PDF file (so you can write answer on it easily).
This repo integrates with streamlit platform for easier use on website.
